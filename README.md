# Guessing Game
## Problem Description
Write a guessing game that asks the user to guess a random number. You should plan for multiple scenarios:
* Correct guess: Write a message that tells the user their guess was correct. Ideally, include the value of the guess in the response.
* Guess too low: Write a message telling the user their guess was too low.
* Guess too high: Write a message telling the user their guess was too high.

You may choose whether to give the user a preset number of guesses or let them guess until they type a command to quit

## Example
```
Value to increment? 5
10
```

## Hints
* Use the section under `if __name__ == '__main__': ` to change arguments and check your work.
* When you are happy with your code, use `input()` to prompt the user for a value.
* Add code to [my_code.py](./my_code.py) to make it do the desired thing.
* Run your code with: `python my_code.py` or the run button
* Run your tests with: `pytest`
